## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my first solo project from Scrimba.  I was provided with a Figma design file and basic HTML and CSS files.  The goal was to use JavaScript to change the scoreboard when pushing the buttons.  When I was building it out, I had a lot of duplicate code that was unnecessary. 

### Continued development

I will be continuing with the projects at Scrimba. These will help me improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to be proficient at web development.
